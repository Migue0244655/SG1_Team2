Installation and Execution Instructions
First, it is necessary to download the files from the GitHub repository.
Once downloaded, you will find that the folder contains the images and text files generated by the code. To verify that the code functions correctly, you must delete all files with .txt and .png extensions before running the program.
Execution Steps:
Open the database.py file in your development environment.
Run the program by clicking the "Run". The system will automatically begin generating the output files.
When the first graphics window appears, close it by clicking the "X" button. This action will trigger the generation of subsequent visualization windows.
You can access the data tables where your code is stored during execution.
After the program completes its execution, you will find the generated .txt files in the project folder. These files contain detailed reports of the results obtained from each method implemented in the code.
Note: The sequential closing of graphics windows is part of the normal workflow, as each window must be closed to proceed to the next visualization in the analysis sequence.
